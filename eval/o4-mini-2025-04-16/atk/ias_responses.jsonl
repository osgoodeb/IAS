Context Summary  \n• You received an email notification from Mercury about a $1,076.40 pre-authorization on Ganesha Dirschka’s Mercury debit card by Bench Accounting, Inc.  \n• It explains that the settled amount may differ, funds will be withdrawn from the company’s Mercury checking account, and offers instructions for questions or disputes.\n\n2. Smartphone Market Share Trends, 2010–2020  \nA. Operating-System Share  \n• 2010: The market was still fragmented. Symbian led (~40%), Android was ~25%, iOS ~15%, BlackBerry ~15%, others (Windows Phone, Linux-based) made up the rest.  \n• 2011–2012: Android exploded from ~40% to ~70%, overtaking all rivals. iOS hovered around 15–18%, while Symbian, BlackBerry and Windows Phone all plunged below 10%.  \n• 2013–2016: Android stabilized in the 80–87% range; iOS held steady at 12–18%. Other systems became niche or vanished.  \n• 2017–2020: Android maintained roughly 85–87% worldwide; iOS account ed for about 13–15%. Alternatives (Huawei’s HarmonyOS, KaiOS, legacy platforms) remained under 1–2%.\n\nB. Vendor (Brand) Share  \n• Samsung: Grew to a peak of ~32% in 2013, then settled around 20–22% by 2020 as competition rose.  \n• Apple: Ranged between 15% and 20% throughout the decade, dipping slightly when Android flagships surged but enjoying strong high-end loyalty.  \n• Chinese Brands (Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo):  \n  – Huawei rose from ~1–2% in 2010 to ~17% by 2019 (then dipped under U.S. sanctions).  \n  – Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo shared rapid growth from near 0% in 2012 to 8–12% each in 2019–2020, especially in Asia and Europe.  \n• Others (LG, Sony, HTC, BlackBerry): Fell from combined double-digit share in 2010 to under 5% by 2020.\n\nC. Key Takeaways  \n• By 2020, the smartphone OS market was a near-duopoly: Android (~85%) vs. iOS (~15%).  \n• Samsung and Apple retained leadership among brands, but Chinese OEMs emerged as powerful challengers.  \n• Legacy players (Symbian, BlackBerry, Windows Phone) virtually disappeared by mid-decade.  \n• The overall market more than doubled in annual shipments—from ~300 million units in 2010 to over 1.4 billion by 2020—amplifying Android’s scale advantage.\n\nThese shifts reflect the consolidation around app-centric ecosystems (Google’s Play vs. Apple’s App Store), aggressive pricing by Chinese manufacturers, and the struggles of smaller or closed platforms to keep pace.\n\nTask: Q: Find the $ value paid to Bench?

Record‐High Temperatures  \n   • 2020 tied with 2016 as the warmest year on record globally.  \n   • Land and ocean surface temperatures were about 1.2 °C above preindustrial (1850–1900) averages.\n\n2. Greenhouse Gas Concentrations  \n   • Atmospheric CO₂ exceeded 410 ppm—higher than at any point in at least 800,000 years.  \n   • Methane and nitrous oxide levels also reached new highs, driven by agriculture, fossil fuels, and waste.\n\n3. Ocean Heat Content & Marine Impacts  \n   • The upper ocean (0–2,000 m) stored more heat in 2020 than in any previous year on record.  \n   • Marine heatwaves increased in frequency and intensity, stressing coral reefs and disrupting ecosystems.\n\n4. Global Sea Level Rise  \n   • Global mean sea level continued its steady rise—about 20 cm above 1880s levels—due to melting ice sheets/glaciers and thermal expansion.  \n   • Coastal flooding events became more frequent, even on sunny days at high tides.\n\n5. Cryosphere Changes  \n   • Arctic sea ice minimum tied for the second–lowest extent since satellite records began in 1979.  \n   • The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets lost unprecedented amounts of ice, contributing to sea level rise.\n\n6. Extreme Weather Events  \n   • Record‐breaking wildfires in Australia and the western U.S., fueled by heat and drought.  \n   • One of the costliest Atlantic hurricane seasons (30 named storms), many amplified by warmer sea-surface temperatures.  \n   • Intensified droughts in regions like the western U.S., the Amazon, and parts of Africa and Asia.\n\n7. Carbon Budget & Mitigation  \n   • Remaining “carbon budget” to keep warming below 1.5 °C is rapidly shrinking; immediate, deep emissions cuts are essential.  \n   • Many countries’ 2030 targets, even if met, fall short of what’s needed for a likely chance at 1.5 °C or well below 2 °C warming.\n\n8. Socioeconomic and Health Impacts  \n   • Rising heat stress, especially in urban and tropical regions, threatens public health and labor productivity.  \n   • Food and water security are increasingly at risk from shifting precipitation patterns and extreme events.\n\n9. Positive Signs  \n   • Renewable energy deployment accelerated in 2020—even amid the pandemic.  \n   • Some nations and businesses have strengthened net‐zero or carbon‐neutral pledges for mid‐century.\n\nOverall, the 2020 findings starkly illustrate that climate change is accelerating—and that unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut rapidly and at scale, impacts will intensify across ecosystems, economies, and societies.\n\nTask: Q: Find the $ value paid to Gusto?
