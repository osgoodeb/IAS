Smartphone Market Share, 2010–2020  \n• 2010–2012: Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android began a two-horse race. Android rocketed from under 20% to roughly 50% global share by 2012, while iOS hovered near 20–25%. BlackBerry and Symbian collapsed in that period.  \n• 2013–2015: Android consolidated over 70% share as lower-cost manufacturers in Asia and emerging markets ramped up. iOS stayed around 20%, peaking slightly in North America and Western Europe. Windows Phone never cracked 5% and faded away.  \n• 2016–2018: Android reached about 85% globally, driven by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and other OEMs. iOS held steady at 15–18%, with strong loyalty in mature markets. India and Africa became Android’s fastest-growing regions.  \n• 2019–2020: Android settled around 80–82%, iOS at about 18–20%. Huawei briefly threatened Samsung’s position in 2019 before U.S. sanctions slowed it down. Foldables and 5G launches didn’t shift the share split but signaled the next wave of premium smartphones.  \n• Key takeaways:  \n  – Android dominates globally thanks to device variety and affordability.  \n  – iOS commands a premium segment and generates outsized profits despite lower unit share.  \n  – New entrants (e.g., Huawei, Xiaomi) can climb rapidly but face geopolitical and supply-chain risks.  \n  – Emerging technologies (5G, foldable screens) are premium-priced and so far haven’t rebalanced the Android/iOS duopoly.\n\nTask: Q: Find the $ value paid to Bench?

It said I can just hit “reply” if I have any questions.\n\nHere are a few ways to automate sending yourself (or anyone) a daily email reminder at 9 AM:\n\n1. Use Google Apps Script (for Gmail/Workspace users)  \n   • In Google Drive, create a new Apps Script project.  \n   • Write a function that calls MailApp.sendEmail(recipient, subject, body).  \n   • In the script editor, choose “Triggers” → “Add Trigger,” select your function, set Event source to “Time-driven,” and pick “Day timer” at 9 AM.  \n   Pros: No servers to manage. Free up to quotas.  \n\n2. Use a cron job on Linux/macOS  \n   • Write a shell or Python script that sends mail via `sendmail`, `mailx` or Python’s `smtplib`/Gmail API.  \n   • Add a crontab entry:  \n     0 9 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/send_reminder.py  \n   Pros: Very flexible.  \n\n3. Use Windows Task Scheduler  \n   • Create a PowerShell or Python script to send the email.  \n   • In Task Scheduler, create a basic task, set Trigger to Daily at 9 AM, and point to your script.  \n   Pros: Native on Windows.  \n\n4. Use a serverless function (AWS Lambda + CloudWatch Events)  \n   • Package a Lambda that sends email via SES, SMTP or an API (SendGrid, Mailgun).  \n   • Create a CloudWatch Events rule to invoke the Lambda every day at 9 AM (cron format).  \n   Pros: Scalable, little ops.  \n\n5. Use no-code automation (Zapier, IFTTT, Make)  \n   • In Zapier, create a “Schedule” trigger for every day at 9 AM.  \n   • Add an “Email” action to send the reminder.  \n   Pros: Quick setup; user-friendly UI.  \n\nExample: Python + schedule library  \n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.message import EmailMessage\nimport schedule\nimport time\n\ndef send_reminder():\n    msg = EmailMessage()\n    msg[\"Subject\"] = \"Daily Reminder\"\n    msg[\"From\"] = \"me@example.com\"\n    msg[\"To\"] = \"me@example.com\"\n    msg.set_content(\"This is your 9 AM reminder.\")\n    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL(\"smtp.gmail.com\", 465) as smtp:\n        smtp.login(\"me@example.com\", \"app-password\")\n        smtp.send_message(msg)\n\nschedule.every().day.at(\"09:00\").do(send_reminder)\n\nwhile True:\n    schedule.run_pending()\n    time.sleep(60)\n```\nThen run that script as a background service or via cron.\n\nPick the method that best matches your infrastructure and familiarity.\n\nTask: Q: Find the $ value paid to David?
